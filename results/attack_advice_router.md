**Title:** Vulnerability Report: Lighttpd HTTP Server and MiniUPnP Service

**Background:** The remote system is running Lighttpd HTTP Server and MiniUPnP Service, which are vulnerable to various attacks. Lighttpd is an open-source web server optimized for speed-critical environments, while MiniUPnP is a software that implements the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol.

**Target Information:**

* Hostname: _gateway
* IP Address: 192.168.0.1
* Open Ports:
	+ Port 80: Lighttpd HTTP Server (tcp)
	+ Port 443: Lighttpd HTTP Server (tcp)
	+ Port 5000: MiniUPnP Service (tcp)
* Product and CPE:
	+ Lighttpd
	+ MiniUPnP 1.9 (UPnP 1.1)

**Suggested Actions:**

1. Lighttpd HTTP Server (Port 80 & 443):
	* Exploit: CVE-2014-2325, CVE-2013-4508
	* Command Line Example: `curl http://192.168.0.1/ -H "Host: vulnerable.com" -v`
2. MiniUPnP UPnP Service (Port 5000):
	* Exploit: CVE-2020-10177, CVE-2019-18955
	* Command Line Example: `curl http://192.168.0.1:5000/ -H "Host: vulnerable.com" -v`

**Potential Impact:**

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:

* Availability: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, causing the system to become unavailable.
* Integrity: Remote code execution, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.
* Confidentiality: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to access sensitive information.
