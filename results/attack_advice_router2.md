**Vulnerability Report: Remote System with Lighttpd and MiniUPnP Services**

**Background:**
The remote system, with hostname "_gateway" and IP address "192.168.0.1", is running multiple services that can be exploited by attackers. The system has open ports 80/tcp, 443/tcp, and 5000/tcp, which correspond to HTTP, HTTPS, and UPnP services, respectively. The HTTP and HTTPS services are provided by Lighttpd, an open-source web server, while the UPnP service is provided by MiniUPnP 1.9.

**Target Information:**

* Hostname: _gateway
* IP Address: 192.168.0.1
* Open Ports:
	+ 80/tcp: HTTP (Lighttpd)
	+ 443/tcp: HTTPS (Lighttpd)
	+ 5000/tcp: UPnP (MiniUPnP 1.9)
* Product and CPE:
	+ Lighttpd (no specific version provided)
	+ MiniUPnP 1.9 (UPnP 1.1)

**Suggested Actions:**
The following attack vectors can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the remote system:

**Lighttpd HTTP Server (80/tcp):**

* Exploit: CVE-2014-2323 - Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd 1.4.31
	+ Command line example: `searchsploit lighttpd 1.4.31`
* Exploit: CVE-2012-5536 - Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd 1.4.28
	+ Command line example: `searchsploit lighttpd 1.4.28`

**Lighttpd HTTPS Server (443/tcp):**
Similar to the HTTP server, but with SSL/TLS enabled.

**MiniUPnP UPnP Service (5000/tcp):**

* Exploit: CVE-2015-2097 - Multiple vulnerabilities in MiniUPnP 1.9
	+ Command line example: `searchsploit miniupnp 1.9`

**Additional Attack Vectors:**

* **Lighttpd:**
	+ Attack vector: EvilDirect Hijacking
	+ Command: Run airgeddon (no specific command provided)
* **MiniUPnP 1.9:**
	+ Attack vector: Spoofing SSDP and UPnP Devices with EvilSSDP
	+ Command: Use EvilSSDP to spoof SSDP and UPnP devices (no specific command provided)

**Potential Impact:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to a significant impact on the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the remote system. An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, disrupt system operations, or inject malicious code. It is essential to address these vulnerabilities promptly to prevent potential attacks.

Remember to always conduct penetration testing legally and with proper authorization.
